- The protocol does not support rebasing tokens
- The protocol does not support fee-on-transfer tokens
- The protocol does not support tokens with more than 18 decimals
- The protocol only supports tokens compliant with the IERC20Metadata interface
- The protocol only supports pre-vetted tokens
- The protocol owner, KEEPER_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE, and BORROW_RATE_UPDATER_ROLE are trusted
- The protocol does not have any fallback oracles.
- Price feeds must be redeployed and updated in case any Chainlink configuration changes (stale price timeouts, decimals, etc)
- In case Chainlink reports a wrong price, the protocol state cannot be guaranteed. This may cause incorrect liquidations, among other issues
- In case the protocol is paused, the price of the collateral may change during the unpause event. This may cause unforseen liquidations, among other issues

# Overview

Size is a credit marketplace with unified liquidity across maturities.

Supported pair:

- (W)ETH/USDC: Collateral/Borrow token

Target networks:

- Ethereum mainnet
- Base

## Documentation

### Overview, Accounting, and Protocol Design

- [Whitepaper](https://docs.size.cash/)

### Technical overview

#### Architecture

The architecture of Size v2 was inspired by [dYdX v2](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/solo), with the following design goals:

- Upgradeability
- Modularity
- Overcome [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170)'s contract code size limit of 24kb
- Maintaining the protocol invariants after each user interaction (["FREI-PI" pattern](https://www.nascent.xyz/idea/youre-writing-require-statements-wrong))

For that purpose, the contract is deployed behind an UUPS-Upgradeable proxy, and contains a single entrypoint, `Size.sol`. External libraries are used, and a single `State storage` variable is passed to them via `delegatecall`s. All user-facing functions have the same pattern:

```solidity
state.validateFunction(params);
state.executeFunction(params);
state.validateInvariant(params);
```

The `Multicall` pattern is also available to allow users to perform a sequence of multiple actions, such as depositing borrow tokens, liquidating an underwater borrower, and withdrawing all liquidated collateral. **Note:** in order to accept ether deposits through multicalls, all user-facing functions have the [`payable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokemak-judging/issues/215) modifier, and `deposit` always uses `address(this).balance` to wrap ether. This means leftover amounts, if [sent forcibly](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/force-feeding/), are always credited to the depositor.

Additional safety features were employed, such as different levels of Access Control (ADMIN, PAUSER_ROLE, KEEPER_ROLE, BORROW_RATE_UPDATER_ROLE), and Pause.

#### Tokens

In order to address donation and reentrancy attacks, the following measures were adopted:

- No withdraws of native ether, only wrapped ether (WETH)
- Underlying borrow and collateral tokens, such as USDC and WETH, are converted 1:1 into deposit tokens via `deposit`, which mints `szaUSDC` and `szWETH`, and received back via `withdraw`, which burns deposit tokens 1:1 in exchange for the underlying tokens.

#### Maths

All mathematical operations are implemented with explicit rounding (`mulDivUp` or `mulDivDown`) using Solady's [FixedPointMathLib](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/utils/FixedPointMathLib.sol). Whenever a taker-maker operation occurs, all rounding tries to favor the maker, who is the passive party. In some generic situations, such as in yield curve calculations, the rounding is always in one direction.

Decimal amounts are preserved until a conversion is necessary:

- USDC/aUSDC: 6 decimals
- WETH/szETH: 18 decimals
- szDebt: same as borrow token
- Price feeds: 18 decimals

All percentages are expressed in 18 decimals. For example, a 150% liquidation collateral ratio is represented as 1500000000000000000.

#### Oracles

##### Price Feed

A contract that provides the price of ETH in terms of USDC in 18 decimals. For example, a price of 3327.39 ETH/USDC is represented as 3327390000000000000000.

##### Variable Pool Borrow Rate Feed

In order to set the current market average value of USDC variable borrow rates, we perform an off-chain calculation on Aave's rate, convert it to 18 decimals, and store it in the Size contract. For example, a rate of 2.49% on Aave v3 is represented as 24900000000000000. The admin can disable this feature by setting the stale interval to zero. If the oracle information is stale, orders relying on the variable rate feed cannot be matched.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
After our last security audit, we implemented numerous fixes and added new features to the protocol. However, these changes were not reviewed by the auditors. We believe these are the most significant untested and potentially vulnerable areas of the protocol.

1. Swap fee: During Spearbit's security review, a critical-severity vulnerability (5.1.1) was discovered that allowed any borrower to avoid paying fees. Consequently, we redesigned our fee mechanism, transitioning from a repayment fee to a swap fee. Rather than charging fees upon loan repayment, we introduced a fee for every cash-for-credit operation.

2. Fragmentation fee: While refactoring our fee structure, we noticed that our previous "early exit fee" was being charged incorrectly in all exits, since the purpose of this fee was to enable us to subsidize `claim`  operations after loan repayments. Because of that, we renamed it to `fragmentationFee` so that it better reflects the intended behavior of this fee, which is to be charged only when there is a credit fractionalization/split. 

3. Liquidations: In Spearbit's security review, several High and Medium-severity vulnerabilities (5.2.1, 5.3.1, 5.3.3) were identified concerning liquidation and self-liquidation incentives. Consequently, we overhauled our incentives mechanism, moving away from a fixed overdue liquidation reward and a variable liquidation reward based on collateral ratio to a variable liquidation reward based on the loan's future value.

4. Create Debt/Credit pair: Following our last audit, we conducted a major refactor to consolidate similar functions into a single function. Additionally, we added optional input parameters to existing functions to enhance their functionality. Specifically:
   - `BorrowAsMarketOrder` was renamed to `SellCreditMarket`. Instead of receiving an array of receivable credit positions, it now accepts a `creditPositionId` parameter. If set to `RESERVED_ID`, it can create a DebtPosition/CreditPosition pair for a "simple borrow". Passing an existing credit position ID allows for a "lender exit".
   - `LendAsMarketOrder` was merged with `BuyMarketCredit` into a single `BuyCreditMarket` function. Like `SellCreditMarket`, it accepts a `creditPositionId` parameter. Setting it to `RESERVED_ID` enables the creation of a DebtPosition/CreditPosition pair for a "simple lend". Passing an existing credit position ID enables a credit buy operation.
   - `BorrowerExit` was eliminated in favor of a `BuyCreditMarket` + `Compensate` flow.
   - `Compensate` now accepts a `creditPositionToCompensateId`. If set to `RESERVED_ID`, it can create a DebtPosition/CreditPosition pair, allowing for debt reduction on an existing loan while creating a new debt. This facilitates partial repayments.

4. Periphery: Liquidaiton contracts to be called by the protocol's keeper bots were added after our last audit
